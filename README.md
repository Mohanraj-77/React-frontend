# React-frontend
I developed an e-commerce website using React.js.
Implemented a Context-Api functionality.
The Context API is a part of React, a popular
JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It
provides a way to pass data through the
component tree without having to pass props down
manually at every level. This simplifies the process
of managing and sharing state between
components.
